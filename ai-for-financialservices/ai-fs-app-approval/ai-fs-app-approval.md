# Application Review Business Processes

## About this workshop

In today's fast-paced digital landscape, automating business processes has become essential for organisations seeking to enhance efficiency, reduce manual errors, and improve customer satisfaction. This article will delve into the automation of a business process, specifically the opening of a new premium bank account.
 
**Use Case: Opening a Premium Bank Account**

The process of opening a premium bank account involves a series of steps, which can be automated to streamline the experience for both the applicant and the bank. The use case is as follows:

- **Application Submission**: An individual interested in opening a premium bank account submits basic information, including:
-  Name and address, Work details or Profession, Education, Income details
- **Unique identifications**: (e.g., photo, driving license, AADHAR, and PAN number in India) 
- **Document Upload**: The applicant uploads supporting documents, such as a copy of their unique ID.
- **Application Review**: The business process checks the uploaded content for validity. If the information is incomplete or inaccurate, or if the income is below the required threshold, the application is rejected.
- **Application Status Update**: If the information is valid, the application status is updated from "Pending" to "Waiting for Approval."
- **Approval Process**: Bank officials review the application and approve or reject it based on the submitted profile and any existing data on the applicant.
- **Account Opening and Notification**: Upon successful completion of the application process, the applicant is notified and becomes a bank customer. They may be required to deposit an initial amount as part of the account opening process and will be provided with a debit or credit card in accordance with the bank's policies.

**Benefits of Automation**

Automating the business process of opening a premium bank account offers numerous benefits, including:

- **Improved Efficiency**: Automation reduces manual errors and streamlines the application process, resulting in faster processing times.
- **Enhanced Customer Experience**: Applicants can track the status of their application in real-time, reducing uncertainty and improving overall satisfaction.
- **Increased Accuracy**: Automated checks ensure that applications are complete and accurate, reducing the risk of errors and rejections.
- **Reduced Costs**: Automation minimizes the need for manual intervention, resulting in cost savings for the bank.

By automating the business process of opening a premium bank account, organizations can improve efficiency, enhance customer experience, and reduce costs. As technology continues to evolve, it is essential for businesses to leverage automation to stay competitive and meet the changing needs of their customers.
